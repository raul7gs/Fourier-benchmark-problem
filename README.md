# Fourier-benchmark-problem
This Github repository contains all the necessary element to execute the dynamic MDA regarding the mathematical problem widely discussed in (thesis link). The problem is intended to be executed in RCE. There are three different folders in the repository. The first folder contains the RCE file. TThe second folder contains all the tools that are needed to be integrated in RCE to execute the problem. Finally, the third folder contains some example architectures to observe the dynamic behaviour in the execution process.

# Implementation process

Before executing any architecture, it is necessary to know
